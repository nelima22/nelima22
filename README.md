### Hello World! üëãüòä

I‚Äôm passionate about using **machine learning** and **healthcare data** to solve real-world problems, be it unlocking insights from genomic data, improving diagnoses with AI, or optimizing clinical workflows.    

My focus spans:  
- **Precision Medicine**: Tailoring treatments using genomic, clinical, and lifestyle data.  
- **Healthcare Analytics**: Transforming raw data (EHRs, claims, labs) into actionable insights.  
- **Bioinformatics**: Bridging biology and data science for biomarker discovery and omics analysis.
- General Data Science and Analytics
