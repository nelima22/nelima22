### Hello World! 👋😊

I’m passionate about using **machine learning** and **healthcare data** to solve real-world problems, be it unlocking insights from genomic data, improving diagnoses with AI, or optimizing clinical workflows.    

My focus spans:  
- **Precision Medicine**: Tailoring treatments using genomic, clinical, and lifestyle data.  
- **Healthcare Analytics**: Transforming raw data (EHRs, claims, labs) into actionable insights.  
- **Bioinformatics**: Bridging biology and data science for biomarker discovery and omics analysis.

### 🛠️ **Skills & Expertise**  
**Clinical Data & Standards**  
- **Medical Coding**: ICD-11 (diagnoses), CPT/HCPCS (procedures), LOINC (labs).  
- **EHR/EMR**: OMOP CDM, FHIR, HL7, clinical NLP.
- **I care about**:  
   🔒 Keeping patient data safe (HIPAA/GDPR-trained)  
   ⚡ Building ML models that work *within* real-world regulations.

**Bioinformatics**  
- Genomic data analysis (WES, RNA-seq), pathway/gene enrichment.  
- Tools: Bioconductor, GATK, PLINK, ANNOVAR.  

**ML/AI**  
- Predictive modeling, survival analysis, NLP for clinical notes.  
- Python (PyTorch, TensorFlow), R, SQL, Databricks.
